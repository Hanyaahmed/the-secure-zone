# Network Merger and Implementation Plan

## Objective
The Network Merger and Implementation Plan project focused on integrating two separate corporate networks into a unified, secure, and efficient infrastructure. The goal was to design a detailed implementation plan that ensures minimal downtime, mitigates security risks, and optimizes network performance. This project provided hands-on experience with network architecture, risk assessment, and strategic planning for enterprise-scale network mergers.

## Skills Learned
- Designing scalable and secure network architectures.
- Conducting network assessments and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
- Planning network integration with minimal service disruption.
- Understanding routing, switching, VLAN segmentation, and firewall rules in a merger context.
- Risk analysis, mitigation planning, and creating comprehensive implementation documentation.
- Collaboration and communication with stakeholders to align technical and business requirements.

### Tools Used
- Network simulation and diagram tools (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, Microsoft Visio).
- Network monitoring and analysis tools (e.g., Wireshark, SolarWinds).
- Documentation tools (e.g., Microsoft Word, Excel, or Confluence) for implementation planning.
- Security and compliance checklists to identify risks and ensure best practices.


## Steps
`Step 1: Network Assessment`

  Ref 1: Network Diagram
-  Documented the existing network architectures of both organizations.
-  Identified overlapping IP ranges, hardware configurations, and potential security gaps.

`Step 2: Risk & Vulnerability Analysis`

  Ref 2: Risk Matrix
- Assessed vulnerabilities such as weak password policies, missing MFA, and misconfigured firewall rules.
- Determined risk severity and likelihood, prioritizing mitigation strategies.

`Step 3: Network Design & Merger Plan`

  Ref 3: Merged Network Diagram

- Developed a detailed plan for IP addressing, VLAN segmentation, and routing.
- Planned hardware and software upgrades necessary for seamless integration.

Step 4: Security Implementation

Screenshot Example: Firewall Rules and Access Control
Ref 4: Security Configuration Screenshot

Defined firewall rules, access policies, and monitoring points to secure the merged network.

Included multi-factor authentication and password policy enhancements.

Step 5: Implementation & Testing

Screenshot Example: Testing and Validation Logs
Ref 5: Test Plan & Results

Simulated network traffic to validate connectivity and performance.

Monitored logs to ensure security controls were effective and no unauthorized access occurred.

Step 6: Documentation & Reporting

Screenshot Example: Final Implementation Report
Ref 6: Implementation Documentation

Compiled comprehensive documentation of the merger process, including network diagrams, configurations, and risk mitigation steps.

Provided actionable recommendations for ongoing monitoring and maintenance.
